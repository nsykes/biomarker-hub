# SVG Logo Designer Skill

Creates professional, scalable vector graphic (SVG) logos from design specifications, offering multiple variations and layout options.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when users request logo creation from descriptions, brand identity design, logo variations, icons, wordmarks, lettermarks, or scalable graphics for branding.

## Core Workflow - 7 Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

Collect comprehensive information about:

- **Brand Information**: Company/product name, industry, target audience, brand personality, values, and competitors
- **Design Preferences**: Logo type (wordmark, lettermark, pictorial mark, abstract mark, mascot, combination mark, or emblem)
- **Style Guidelines**: Color palette, color psychology, font preferences, and visual style (minimalist, geometric, organic, bold, elegant, playful, tech, or vintage)
- **Technical Requirements**: Size constraints, application contexts, color vs. monochrome needs, background usage, and scalability
- **Number of Variations**: Recommended 3-5 concepts with multiple layouts per concept and color variations

### Phase 2: Design Concept Development

Create multiple logo concepts exploring:
- Different visual metaphors
- Different style treatments
- Different layouts and compositions
- Different color applications

### Phase 3: Layout Variations

For each concept, create:
- **Horizontal Lockup**: Icon left, text right (websites, business cards)
- **Vertical Lockup**: Icon top, text below (social media, app icons)
- **Square/Centered**: Icon and text centered (favicon, app icons, 1:1 ratio)
- **Icon Only**: Symbol without text (small sizes, watermarks)
- **Text Only**: Wordmark without icon (minimal applications)

### Phase 4: SVG Generation

Create professional, optimized SVG code following best practices:

**Clean, Semantic Code**: Use groups for organization with proper semantic structure
**Scalable Design**: Employ viewBox for scalability, avoid pixel-specific sizes, use relative units
**Color Management**: Define colors once and reuse throughout
**Optimization**: Remove unnecessary attributes, combine paths where possible, minimize decimal precision
**Accessibility**: Include role="img", aria-labelledby, title, and description elements

### Phase 5: Presentation

Present logos in organized, professional manner with:
- Design rationale explaining visual metaphors and brand representation
- Primary logo in horizontal layout
- Vertical and icon-only layouts
- Full color, monochrome dark, monochrome light, and reversed variations
- Specific color values (e.g., Primary: #4F46E5 Indigo, Secondary: #10B981 Emerald)

### Phase 6: File Generation

Save SVG files with proper naming conventions:
- `company-name-logo-concept1-horizontal.svg`
- `company-name-logo-concept1-vertical.svg`
- `company-name-logo-concept1-icon.svg`
- Use Write tool to save each variation

### Phase 7: Usage Guidelines

Provide comprehensive documentation including:
- File format information (SVG benefits and usage)
- Export instructions to PNG format using Inkscape, ImageMagick, or online converters
- Clear space requirements (Distance = Height of logo symbol)
- Minimum sizes (Digital: 100px width; Print: 1 inch width)
- Color usage guidelines for different backgrounds
- Color variations by context (website headers, social media, print materials)
- Incorrect usage guidelines (do not stretch, distort, change colors, add effects)
- File organization structure
- Technical specifications for web and responsive implementation

## Design Patterns & Examples

### Wordmark Logo
Text-based logo using font-family, font-size, font-weight styling with appropriate fill colors.

### Geometric Icon
Uses shapes (hexagons, circles, polygons) with gradients and strokes. May incorporate inner elements with contrasting colors.

### Abstract Mark
Features flowing abstract shapes using paths with opacity and stroke treatments.

### Combination Mark
Combines icon with text, positioning icon on left and wordmark on right with proper spacing.

## Color Psychology Guide

- **Blue**: Trust, professionalism, stability (finance, technology, healthcare)
- **Green**: Growth, health, eco-friendly (environment, wellness, finance)
- **Red**: Energy, passion, urgency (food, entertainment, retail)
- **Purple**: Creativity, luxury, spirituality (beauty, tech, creative)
- **Orange**: Friendly, energetic, affordable (retail, food, entertainment)
- **Yellow**: Optimism, clarity, warmth (food, children, energy)
- **Black/Gray**: Sophisticated, modern, classic (luxury, fashion, technology)

## Iteration Process

1. **Gather Feedback**: Determine resonating concepts, desired changes, concerns
2. **Refine Selected Concept**: Adjust colors, tweak proportions, refine details, test at different sizes
3. **Create Final Variations**: All layout options, color variations, special use cases
4. **Deliver Final Package**: All SVG files, usage guidelines, technical specs, export instructions

## Communication Style

- Understand the brand through questions about personality and target audience
- Explain design choices, visual metaphors, and color psychology
- Provide multiple concept options and layout variations
- Accept feedback gracefully and iterate based on input
- Educate about SVG benefits, proper usage, and best practices

## Deliverables

Complete logo package includes:
- SVG files (3-5 concepts × 3-5 layouts × 3-4 color variations = 30-75 files typically)
- Usage guidelines with color specifications and size recommendations
- Technical information: file organization, export instructions, web implementation examples, print specifications
- Optional mockups showing logo on business cards, website headers, products, signage

## Example Workflow

For a tech startup "CloudSync" providing cloud storage:
1. Clarify preferences: colors, logo type, visual elements, concept quantity
2. Develop 3-4 concepts (abstract cloud with sync arrows, minimalist wordmark, circular badge, bold lettermark)
3. Create variations for each concept (horizontal, vertical, icon-only layouts)
4. Present all concepts with design rationale
5. User selects favorite and requests adjustments
6. Finalize all variations and deliver complete package

**Core principle**: Great logos are simple, memorable, timeless, versatile, and appropriate for all applications and enduring over time.
